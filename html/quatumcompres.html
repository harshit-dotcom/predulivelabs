                            Quantum Computing is the process of using quantum-mechanics for solving complex and massive
                            operations quickly and efficiently. As classical computers are used for performing classical
                            computations, similarly, a Quantum computer is used for performing Quantum computations.
                            Quantum computing is an area of computing focused on developing computer technology based on
                            the principles of quantum theory, which explains the behaviour of energy and material on the
                            atomic and subatomic levels.
                            Classical computers that we use today can only encode information in bits that take the
                            value of 1 or 0.

                        <h5> Cybersecurity </h5>
                        Personal information is stored in computers in the current era of digitization. So, we need a
                        very strong system of cybersecurity to protect data from stealing. Classical computers are good
                        enough for cybersecurity, but the vulnerable threats and attacks weaken it.
                        Scientists are working with quantum computers in this field. It is also found that it is
                        possible to develop several techniques to deal with such cybersecurity threats via machine
                        learning.

                        It is also a field of security where quantum computers are helping to develop encryption methods
                        to deliver the packets onto the network safely. Such creation of encryption methods is known as
                        Quantum Cryptography.

                        Sometimes, the process of analyzing becomes too long to forecast the weather using classical
                        computers. On the other hand, Quantum Computers have enhanced power to analyze, recognize the
                        patterns, and forecast the weather in a short period and with better accuracy.
                        Even quantum systems are able to predict more detailed climate models with perfect timings.

                        AI has become an emerging area of digitization. Many tools, apps, and features have been
                        developed via AI and ML. As the days passing by, numerous applications are being developed.
                        As a result, it has challenged the classical systems to match up accuracy and speed. But,
                        Quantum computers can help to process such complex problems in less time for which a classical
                        computer will take hundreds of years to solve those problems.

                        <h5> Drug Design and Development </h5>
                        Drug designing and development is a typical job to be done. It is because the development of
                        drugs is based on trial and error methods, which is expensive as well as risky tasks.
                        It is also a challenging task for quantum computers too. It is the researcher's hope and belief
                        that quantum computing can become an effective way of knowing the drugs and their reactions over
                        human beings.
                        The day when quantum computing will successfully become capable of drug development, it will
                        save a lot of time and money for drug industries. Also, more drug discoveries could be made with
                        better results for the pharmaceutical industries.

                        customers. Such industries need unique and effective strategies to get growth.
                        Although in conventional computers, the technique of Monte Carlo simulations is being used, in
                        turn, it consumes a lot of time on the computer.
                        However, if such complex calculations are performed by a quantum system, it will improve the
                        quality of solutions and decrease development time.

                        The superposition and entanglement properties of a quantum computer may provide superpowers to
                        machines for successfully mapping the molecules. As a result, it opens several opportunities in
                        the field of pharmaceutical research.
                        More massive problems that a quantum computer can handle include creating room-temperature
                        superconductors, creating ammonia-based fertilizer, creating solid-state batteries, and removing
                        CO2 (carbon dioxide) for a better climate, etc. Quantum computing will be the most prominent in
                        the field of computational chemistry.

                        Conventional Computing is being used for improving data analysis and robust modeling by enabling
                        various industries to optimize their logistics and scheduling workflows associated with their
                        supply-chain management.
                        Such operating models continuously perform the calculations and recalculations for finding the
                        optimal routes of fleet operations, air traffic control, and traffic management. Some of these
                        operations can become complex and difficult for classical computers to solve.Thus, quantum
                        computing can become an ideal computing solution to solve such complex problems.
                        In quantum computing, two approaches are used, which are:

                            They can process data 1000 times faster than normal computers and supercomputers. Some calculations if performed by a normal computer can take 1000 years are done by quantum computers in a few seconds.

                    &bullet; CONCLUSION
                </h5>
                <p>
                    The field of quantum computing is growing rapidly as many of today's leading computing groups,
                    universities, colleges, and all the leading IT vendors are researching the topic. This pace is
                    expected to increase as more research is turned into practical applications. Although practical
                    machines lie years in the future, this formerly fanciful idea is gaining plausibility.
                    Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize computation by making certain types of
                    classically intractable problems solvable. While no quantum computer is yet sophisticated enough to
                    carry out calculations that a classical computer can't, great progress is underway.
